# Simple Example of Variable Switching Without a Temp Variable

* Arithmetic Swaps Using Addition and Subtraction
* Arithmetic Swaps Using Multiplication and Division
* Bitwise Swaps Using XOR

### Problems with Arithmetic
* Multiplication and Division cannot be used where one variable is 0
* Numbers too large for both Addition and Multiplication operations could go out of integer range
